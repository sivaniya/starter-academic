I started my graduate studies under the supervision of Drs. Natasha Rajah and Debra Titone. For my MSc Thesis I investigated whether multilingualism over the lifespan impacts women and men in a way that differentially buffers against age-related declines in executive control.  The unique sex effects observed in the completion of this MSc project inspired me to pursue sex differences in episodic memory in healthy aging for my PhD work under the primary supervision of Dr. Rajah. I am currently conducting a multivariate Partial Least Squares fMRI analysis to study brain-behaviour correlations in episodic memory on a healthy adult lifespan sample. Through my research training, I am interested in exploring sex differences in brain aging and memory through the use of different methodological (i.e., relationship between structure, function, and behaviour) and statistical approaches.
